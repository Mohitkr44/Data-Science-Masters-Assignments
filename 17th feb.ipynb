    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database system that stores data in a document-oriented format. Instead of using tables and rows like in traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in documents that are organized into collections. These documents can contain a variety of data types, such as arrays and nested documents, and can be easily updated and queried.These documents are stored in bson (binary JSON) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model. Instead, they use different data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph-based, to store and organize data. Non-relational databases are often used for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they can be more flexible and scalable than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and scalability are important: MongoDB is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it a good choice for handling large and complex data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for more agile and iterative development, as changes can be made to the database schema without requiring a complete redesign of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data and real-time analytics: MongoDB is well-suited for big data and real-time analytics, as it can easily handle unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",

    "Cloud-based applications: MongoDB is often used for cloud-based applications, as it can easily scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.\n",

    "In MongoDB, data is organized into a hierarchy of databases, collections, and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a container for a set of collections, each with its own set of documents. In MongoDB, you can have multiple databases within a single MongoDB server instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in a relational database. Collections are used to group related documents together and typically have a common schema, although MongoDB's flexible document model allows for some variation within a collection. Each collection within a MongoDB database is given a unique name that is used to identify and access the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A document is a set of key-value pairs that is stored within a collection. In MongoDB, a document is similar to a record in a relational database, but it is stored in a flexible and dynamic format known as BSON (Binary JSON). Each document can have its own unique structure and can include nested sub-documents and arrays.\n",
    "These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support ad hoc queries - In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing - You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication - MongoDB supports Master Slave replication. A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplication of data - MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load balancing - It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a schema-less database written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to administer in the case of failures.\n",
